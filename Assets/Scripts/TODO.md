TODO LIST

1. Missile Physics
  1. Sine wave oscillations to simulate homing over correction
  2. Final gameplay testing for each missile.
2. Gameplay
  1. Add new types of missiles
    * Long-fast missile
	* Crazy red missile
	* Tiny slow missiles meant for barraging
	* Differentiate medium missile into gray(slow) and blue(slightly faster)
	* Potentially more gameplay testing on the original to find more types
  2. Missile random spawner. Should get more difficult over time
  3. Bonus star spawner
     * Spawn randomly from array of bonus patterns (single, line, diamond)
	 * Bonus star collision adds one star to the UI (IMPLEMENTED, TESTING 8/30)
  4. Power-up spawner
	 * Spawn less often than stars randomly from array of power-ups, no world overlap
  5. Point scoring
  6. Missile and bonus/powerup offscreen position indicators (IMPLEMENTED, TESTING 8/30)
  7. Gameover and scoring
3. UI
  1. Intro screen
  2. Game over screen and restart functionality
